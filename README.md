# 🐳 DockScope - Container Monitoring & Alerting System

DockScope is a lightweight, agent-based container monitoring and alerting tool.  
It collects metrics from Docker containers using a local agent and aggregates them on a central backend.  
InfluxDB is used for time-series data storage and React is used for the frontend dashboard.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GovindSingh9447/dockscope.git
cd dockscope
````

---

### 2. 🛠️ Backend Setup (Go + SQLite + InfluxDB)

```bash
cd backend
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

Ensure InfluxDB and SQLite are correctly set up and accessible via `backend/db`.

---

### 3. ⚙️ Agent Setup

```bash
cd agent
go run main.go
```

Agents must be deployed on each Docker host to collect metrics and send to the backend.

---

### 4. 💻 Frontend Setup (React)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

> You must first add the actual React project inside the `frontend/` folder.
> If not initialized yet, run:

```bash
npx create-vite@latest frontend --template react
```

---

## 🌐 API Endpoints

- `GET /containers` — List running containers
- `GET /metrics` — Real-time container metrics
- `GET /logs?id=<container_id>` — Logs of specific container
- `GET /alerts` — Active alert rules and triggers
- `POST /agent/metrics` — Used by agents to send metrics
- `POST /agent/logs` — Used by agents to send logs

---

## 📊 Metrics Storage

- **SQLite** is used for lightweight persistent storage.
- **InfluxDB** handles time-series metrics.
- Alerts and logs are also optionally persisted for analysis.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Golang
- **Frontend:** React (Vite)
- **Storage:** SQLite, InfluxDB
- **Agent:** Lightweight Go binary
